                    Past lorem ipsum served the same purpose for written content as stock photos do now. The original lorem ipsum used a section of a book called "De Finibus Bonorum et Dolorem," written by the Ancient Roman author Cicero. Old-style printing presses required tedious hand-setting of each letter and punctuation mark. So instead, workers would create type specimen books using preset words and paragraphs from Cicero's treatise to save time.
